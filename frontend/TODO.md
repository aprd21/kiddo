1. For the english section, we aren't honoring the mixed difficulty and the ratio to show puzzles from previous levels
2. Themes are not being respected for english.
3. Can we show small pictures next to the words being generated so kids have an idea of what the word is? (e.g. for "cat", show a picture of a cat)
4. For reading mode in english puzzles, we should also add levels. Level 1 : 2 & 3 letter words. Level 2 : 4 letter words. Level 3 : 5 letter words. Level 4 : 6 letter words. Level 5 : 7 letter words. Level 6 : 8 letter words. Level 7 : 9 letter words. Level 8 : 10 letter words. 
We should've similar settings to math mode for mixed difficulty and teh ratio mode.
